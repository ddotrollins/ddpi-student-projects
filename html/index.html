    This project measures the significant aspects of health concerns around the world. Relating to every populated continent, the  data statistics present information of apparent concern. These health-related issues include that of blood lead content, second hand smoke, and life expectancies per populated continent.</small>

  <div class="panel-body">
      The graphs represented show the health data around the globe. The correlation among the WHO regions of health crises include blood lead levels, secondhand smoke, and life expectancy. In the three data sets, the blood lead data set shows the highest lead in countries in which they are developing, but have a high density of people per capita. In the second hand smoke data set, the data shows the highest smoke content in developed countries, but with not much restriction on smoking. In the life expectancy data set, the data shows the lowest life expectancy in western nations.

  <div class="panel-body">
    From this project we learned that due to changes in society, the correlation among the health standings in continents globally. The surprisingly high percentages of lead content in blood and second hand smoke as well as the low life expectancy in society struck us when we first saw the data, so we decided to present the data in the charted graphs.
