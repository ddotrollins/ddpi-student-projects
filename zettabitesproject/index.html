		The charts
		</p>

		<p>
		As all of us know, when we approach the southern part of the country, Temperature gets higher. If we go even lower, into central America, we will find the temperature to be even higher. Is there a pattern in temperature? Here is some data:

	<div id="div3">

	</div>

	<div id="div4">
		<p>As you can see, this is a scatter plot, relating the latitudinal location of U.S. cities, such as Atlanta or Los Angeles, to the relative temperature exhibited in each city.
		</p>
		<p>
		It seems to be that the lower a city in the US, the higher the temperature there. But because it doesn't include specific location,  we charted a graph that combined the location, latitude + longitude, and the temperature displayed. We did this, and got the following:

		<p>
		This is a map of the United States: In this geographical bubble chart, one can observe:
		</p>
		<p>
 		Relative temperature, with hotter zones having bigger red bubbles, and colder zones showing small, blue bubbles
 		</p>
 		<p>
		Location: Running the latitudinal and longitudinal data against a map of the U.S., it displays the precise locations of each city.

		The not-so-surprising-discovery:
		</p>

		<p>
		After we had the data, it was obvious we had to interpret what we were seeing, so we did. What we saw was that, indeed, cities nearer to the equator are hotter, and further north are not as hot.

			Why?

		<p id="head">
			So what did we learn?
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>The closer we go to the equator, the hotter it gets.</li>
		<li>The sunlight makes the equator hot, because the sun shines directly on it.</li>
		<li>How to interpret datasets
		<br>And of course..
		<li>We learned how to make complicated web pages and how to code with html, javascript and css.
