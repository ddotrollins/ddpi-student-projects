# Digital Design and Programming Institute

## Course Overview
This Institute is intended for students new to computer programming, coding, and digital design. You will investigate how data and the innovation, disruption, and creation of new technologies across smartphones, tablets, laptops, and PCs impact our world. Advanced technology is growing in all directions. In every direction, data capture, retrieval and discovery is key to answer the why, what, where, and how for any subject. Basic internet coding and design using big data in the cloud or in massive data warehouses is impacting every career field â€“ from sociology to international studies and medicine. 

Throughout your time in the program, you will engage with guest speakers from the field, visit a D.C. tech firm, and be introduced to the concepts of data driven computer technology. At the end of the Institute, you will be able to demonstrate why big data, digital literacy, and computational thinking are fast becoming mainstream skills sets for success in the 21st century.
