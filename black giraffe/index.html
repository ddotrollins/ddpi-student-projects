			<p id="font">
			We decided to look at household energy, the increase throughout years, and its specific uses in the houses. Because of the advances in technology since 1967 (the first year of our data) we thought that the levels had to have gone up. So we researched what the levels were and how they have increased, probably because of technology.
			</p> <br>

			<div id="hi"><img src="img/datevsvalue.png"></div>
			<p id="font">
			We found the energy usage in an average house in 1967, and in the years until the present. On this graph there are points recorded every five years, starting at 1970 and continuing until 2015. The level at 1967 was 21.300, it increased to 115.600 in 2000, and now, in 2016, it is 188.650. In 2014, the levels have been the highest, reaching 203.760 in July. There has been a slight decrease since. The decrease in energy shows that people are noticing this increase, and its possibility to impact the environment negatively, and therefore trying to bring the levels back down. Hopefully technology continues to advance, while being able to decrease energy usage through being more power efficient. From this graph you can see that the energy levels increase steadily throughout the years.
			</p> <br>

			<div id="hi"><img src="img/singlefamily.png" height="350"></div>
			<p id="font">
			The pie chart describes 2009â€™s percentages of energy to further break down this energy usage. This is from an average single-family household. It is broken into space heating, water heating, air-conditioning, refrigeration, and other, and it is recorded in British thermal units. Space heating was the highest percentage (41%) of total energy use. The least was refrigeration, with only 4%. This shows how an average single-family uses energy in their household.
			</p> <br>

			<div id="hi"><img src="img/urbanvsrural.png" height="390"></div>
			<p id="font">
			In total, rural households use more energy than urban households. However, some of the specifc consumer levels of the urban households are higher than the rural.
			</p> <br>

			<div id="hi"><img src="img/EnergybyState.png" height="300"></div>
			<p id="font">
			The chart above describes the average amount of energy states use in households. The highest levels are Illinois and New Jersey, and the lowest levels are Florida and California.
			</p> <br>

			<div id="finalnotes"><p id=font><strong>FINAL NOTES</strong></p></div>
			<p id="font">
			We learned that energy consumption grew higher over the 50 recorded years, presumably because of technology. It was interesting to see which parts of an average house need the most energy to function. In total, the rural houses consume more energy than urban houses, but there is a range for the specific consumers.<br>
			If we continued this project, we would find data on different types of energy usage, not only households. For example, we could research how much energy the US government uses, and compare it to the amounts of energy that other countries use. We would also edit our website to make it neater and more clear for each topic, instead of one long page.</p> <br>
