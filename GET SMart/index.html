		 		Not everyone in the world has access to clean drinkable water, like we have in the US. Throughout the world there are people that do not use improved drinking water sources. Some countries have worse statistics than others, but it’s clear to see the global disparities. We chose to represent this particular set of data because we believe that everyone has the right to drink clean water and it’s important that even though we have those resources we remember that elsewhere in the world some do not.

		   		These graphs show the percent of the population using improved water sources in 2015, representing over 100 countries. Dozens of countries represented have less than 80% of their populations using improved drinking-water sources.

				<h2> Over Time </h2>
				<p>
		  			This graph shows the increases or decreases in percentages over recent years, beginning with 1990 to 2015. Many countries have seen great advancements in their sanitation and water access but this progress is not universal and countries still struggle, some have even seen drops in percentages due to a variety of reasons, primarily natural disasters.

			<h2> Rural v Urban </h2>
			<p id="Urbanvrural">
		  		This graph depicts the compared percentages of the population using improved drinking-water in rural communities versus urban communities in particular countries in 2015. The countries were chosen based off their different data to prove that there are stark contrasts of the population drinking clean water in different communities. The countries selected were Chad, India, Pakistan, Swaziland, and Thailand. Chad had a 27% difference from the urban community compared to the rural. India had a 4.5% difference from the rural community to the urban. Pakistan had a 4% difference from urban to rural. Swaziland urban population had 24.7% more than the rural community. And finally, Thailand had a .4% greater rural population drinking clean water compared to the urban community.

 		<h2> How to Help </h2> 
 		<div id="help">
 			<p>
				This is a very important topic because lives are literally at stake. However, there are different organizations and people striving to end the pressing problem of the lack of water. Water.org, for example, is taking many different initiatives to end this problem. They are participating in micro-funding and creating wells as a more accessible way to get water in different areas. But, there are ways we can help. We can donate to many different charities and organizations, and also just be thankful for the water we have and is accessible for us. There are other ways to help that can be found at:

		<h2> Conclusion </h2>
		<div id="conclusion">
			<p> 
				We both learned how much effort goes into websites, even if they are simple. We also learned the basics of how to create websites and write in multiple languages. Our capstone project also educated us on the inequalities of the world and how fortunate we are in the United States to have access to those resources. If we had more time to work on our project we would add more interactive graphs. If we had more time at Georgetown we would like to learn more about how to use the languages better and do more specific actions.
